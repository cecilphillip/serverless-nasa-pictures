> This code is inspired by a blog post written by @aprilspeight on the Twilio blog [Create a NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day Scheduled SMS with Python, Twilio and Azure Functions](https://www.twilio.com/blog/nasa-astronomy-picture-day-scheduled-sms-python-twilio-azure-functions)

This repo contains a sample application, written is various programming languages, that shows how to use an Azure Functions TimerTrigger to call the [NASA  Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API](https://api.nasa.gov/). Afterwards, Twilio is used to send a SMS message with the retrived picture.

Read through the blog post highlighted above to get a full understanding of how the app is put together.
